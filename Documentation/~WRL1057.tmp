Starting and Ending a game in the Server

Here I will describe all the actions that take place from starting the application, 2 players joining and the game ending in one of three ways.
1. The Server/Server/Starter.java class is run. This Class creates a ServerController.
2. In the Constructor of the ServerController Class a new ServerGUI is created. The Instance variables of the ServerController class are initialized. 
3. The View/ServerGui.java
