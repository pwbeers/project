Starting and Ending a game in the Server

Here I will describe all the actions that take place from starting the application, 2 players joining and the game ending in one of three ways.
1. The Server/Server/Starter.java class is run. This Class creates a ServerController.
2. In the Constructor of the ServerController Class a new ServerGui is created. The Instance variables of the ServerController class are initialized. 
3. The View/ServerGui.java Class is initialized by the ServerController. It initializes its graphical elements and displays the current ip-address of the system.
[USER] The user enters a port number in the JTextField next to the label which says “Port: “ or does not change the default value 2220 and pushes the “Start” button.
1. The ServerController acts as an ActionListener and receives and ActionPerformed ActionEvent. It checks if the port number is indeed a number and if it is between 1025 and 65536. Then it calls the startServerSocketListener() method.
2. startServerSocketListener creates a new ServerSocket and a new ServerSocketListener. It also starts the ServerSocketListener Thread.
3. The ServerSocketListener initialized it’s instance variables and assigns the flag for the run method to true
